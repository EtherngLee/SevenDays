The places we conquered were usually unprepared for our attacks, but even so, the working conditions were
filthy and terrible. Corpses lined the streets and we were constantly covered in ash and blood and grime. We
heard so many screams of the dying and wounded that it has become our normal. I wish we could go back. I wish
we never have to do this again.
