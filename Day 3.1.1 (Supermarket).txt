Avoiding the alienâ€™s line of sight, you edge your way past countless mounds of rubble towards the supermarket.

You sneak towards the back of the supermarket and climb up onto a rusted ladder towards a window on the second
floor.

The window is cracked and rusted, with flakes of metal peeling off as you yank on the grills to try to
get it open.

After a long battle of tugging at the grills and mullion, the window finally creaks open, allowing you to
barely squeeze in.

The attic is dusty and battered, with a rotten wood floor that feels like it would give out if you applied your
full weight to it.

As you look through the gaps in the floor, you see a lone alien guarding the supermarket, along with a heap of
canned foods and drinks behind him.

The alien is in a scout outfit instead of the typical footman.

He is lightly clothed with a laser rifle slung along his back protrusions from his wristguard, which are most
likely energy daggers.

He seems to be a distracted as he is twirling a human pistol on his pinky.

There are two options here, you could either stealthily steal the food and run away or fight against the alien.

The alien is facing away from the food stash towards the entrance, so he might not be able to catch you if you
decide to steal the food. However, you also have the element of surprise. If you take him out, you could
salvage his gear which could lead to having a higher probability of surviving in the coming days.
