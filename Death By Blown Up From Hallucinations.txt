You squeeze your eyes shut, twist a knob on the side of the rifle, and slowly press on the trigger.

The gun heats up and begins to rattle.

The laser rifle grows hotter and hotter, blistering your fingers.

You risk a glance. That’s not what rifles are supposed to do. It’s glowing orange and making a strange ticking
sound, as if—

It hits you, with a gasp of horror, that these rifles were likely designed to self destruct if not being used
by the assigned alien.

You resign yourself to your fate, content with the fact that you’re at least bringing some down with you.

The ticking stops, you drop the rifle, and your vision becomes a bright, bright white.

An intense burning envelopes your body and then all goes black.
