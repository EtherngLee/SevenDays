The thoughts are getting louder and louder and faster and faster.

There is no way you are getting any sleep.

You’re stuck in a vicious cycle of feeling worse and thinking more.

Everything is a what if, what if, what if. What if you starve? Get blown apart by aliens? Get kidnapped and
forced to turn into a living bomb? What happens after you die?

You hate to admit it but you’re absolutely terrified. The more you ruminate, the stronger your fears become.

You can practically see them happening in front of your eyes, each scenario being acted out in horrifying
detail, your terror shifting and coalescing and manifesting before your eyes.
