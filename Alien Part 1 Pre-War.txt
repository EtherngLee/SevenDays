It has been a long three years. They did not heed the writing on the wall. We used to live in a paradise of
blue. The clean, sparkling water, they said, would never run out. Our planet is one of water, they said, this
resource will be eternal. So they pumped it out to make our spaceships and our touchscreens and our weapons.
The same stuff used to nourish our bodies provided power for our technology. The corporations only cared about
growing bigger and selling more. And they did grow, and they did sell, and we expanded our empire beyond the
stars, at the cost of our home.

When the water dwindled, the wars began. The rich claimed the last of it for their families, the poor were
wasted away. Desperation is a powerful thing. We turned to begging, stealing, and murder. Being outside was a
dangerous choice; anything could happen and nobody cared.

Those in power turned a blind eye because they had enough for themselves, for now. Until they didnâ€™t and they
picked us up off the streets with the promise of water and suited us up with powerful weapons and taught us to
hate other civilizations that had this precious resource because we deserved it and it should belong to us.
