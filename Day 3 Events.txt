You’re running low on supplies.

You can already feel your throat drying up and your stomach growling.

You scour every corner of your bunker, hoping for an extra morsel of anything to add to your meagre collection.

The decision you knew you would need to make but didn’t want to think about is quickly approaching.

You try to calm your whirling thoughts to make a rational decision, but your brain refuses to listen.

The fact that you need to make this decision in the first place is almost scarier than the decision itself.

To leave, or not to leave, that is the question. Whether tis wiser in your mind to suffer the aches and pains
of relative safety, or to take your chance against a colony of troubles.

Do you stay inside, or do you leave?
