You wake up drenched in a cold sweat with your heart racing.

It was a dream. All of it was a dream.

You sink back with relief, but your relief is short-lived as you suddenly remember the events that transpired
the day before the last.

You killed an alien. Would they come for revenge?

This thought sets your heart racing once again, and this time, the panic doesn’t go away.

The reality of your circumstances has started to set in fully.

You’re alone, you’re running out of resources, and the future is so uncertain you don’t even know what’s going
to happen in the next fifteen minutes. There’s fucking aliens running around outside committing mass murder or
something.

And you stole the laser rifle from one of them. Does it have a location tracker on it? Are aliens that are this
prone to violence vengeful?

The more you think, the harder it gets to breathe and the tighter your chest gets.

What ifs are swirling inside your head. Your fingers are tingling unpleasantly and you’re shaking so hard you
collapse.

You need to calm down. Deep breaths. In and out. Count backwards from ten.

None of it works.

You have exactly one pill left in your backpack that could help with this, but you don’t know if you would need
it in a more important situation later. What if this happens when you’re not somewhere safe like your bunker?
