Avoiding the alienâ€™s line of sight, you edge your way past countless mounds of rubble towards the supermarket.

You sneak towards the back of the supermarket and climb up back into the window on the second floor.

The attic is dusty and battered, with a rotten wood floor that feels like it would give out if you applied your
full weight to it.

As you look through the gaps in the floor, you see a lone alien guarding the supermarket, along with a heap of
canned foods and drinks behind him.

This time the alien is heavily armored with a laser rifle in his arms.

After the death of a previous comrade, the aliens sent a more powerful and experienced soldier.

You have two options. You could either stealthily steal the food and run away or fight against the alien.

Unlike before, you have a powerful laser rifle you could use to kill the alien. Even though he is heavily
armored, one shot of a laser rifle looks like it should be an instant kill.
