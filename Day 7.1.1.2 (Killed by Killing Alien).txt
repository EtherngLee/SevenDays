You unsling your laser rifle and aim it at the alien.

As you squint your eyes to get a good aim, a holographic scope materializes out of thin air, giving you a sure
kill shot.

You twist a knob on the side of the rifle and slowly press on the trigger, which heats up the gun and rattles
it.

The laser rifle grows hotter and hotter, blistering your fingers.

That’s not what rifles are supposed to do. It’s glowing orange and making a strange ticking sound, as if—

It hits you, with a gasp of horror, that these rifles were likely designed to self destruct if not being used
by the assigned alien.

You resign yourself to your fate, content with the fact that you’re at least bringing an alien down with you.

The ticking stops, you drop the rifle, and your vision becomes a bright, bright white.

An intense burning envelopes your body and then all goes black.
