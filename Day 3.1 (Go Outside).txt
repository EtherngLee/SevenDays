As you step into your former house, reality hits you like a truck.

Your home, the place you shared endless memories with is now a dilapidated mess of bricks and random furniture
strewn about.

You fondly reminisce your days of youth, running around the hallway, playing video games in the living room
till the wee hours of the morning. The place you shared those memories with will never come back.

You slowly and quietly shove away all the bricks blocking the entrance and climb out, being extremely careful
not to make too much noise and alert any aliens.

Hiding behind a wall, you peek out into the road and spot roughly a dozen aliens patrolling the surroundings,
fully equipped with crystal-like armor and wielding laser rifles.

Most of the surrounding buildings have been destroyed, leaving this town only a shell of its former self.

The road is filled with blood stains and scraps of clothing, and a few hundred meters away you spy a giant
mound of bodies.

The burnt smell of rotten flesh wafts into your nose, making you gag and feel faint.

As you recollect yourself, you carefully analyze your surroundings and spot an intact buildings in the
vicinity: the local supermarket.

Just as you are about to make your way there, you spot a faint moving figure from the corner of your eye.

On closer inspection, you realize that it is a fellow survivor making his way through the neighborhood.

You could either immediately go to the supermarket or go and approach the survivor.
