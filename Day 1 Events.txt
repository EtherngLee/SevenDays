It is mid-afternoon when you receive the message on your government-issued digital pager.

Luckily, you already are inside your bunker.

The electric grid appears to have been shut off, so the screens you have installed are currently in their
see-through state, revealing four grey concrete walls.

You also have that backpack full of the nonperishable survival items you knew would come in hand, cursing
yourself for not buying more sooner.

You know you can only go one day without water and two days without food, so you will have to be careful with
how you spend your rations.

You clip on the pager, knowing it would be a good idea to periodically check it for updates.

Night is drawing near and although you canâ€™t see it, you know the sky is darkening outside and so you tuck
yourself in bed to prepare for a long day ahead.
