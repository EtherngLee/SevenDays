You step out amidst the smoldering remains of rubble, the air thicker and hotter than you remembered it being
just three days ago.

Smoke billows around you and ash falls from above like snowflakes from hell.

The skyline, normally consisting of tall buildings against a blue sky, was filled with the glow of dancing
flames.

Red on red. Black on red?

Still looking up overhead, you notice as the giant silhouette of a sleek, hypermodern spacecraft eclipses
everything around you.

The primal part of your brain screams at you to run, but your feet are planted firmly in the ground and refuse
to budge.

Even as you watch the spaceship come to a stop. Even as you know, sure as anything, of what will happen next.

It all seems to occur in slow motion. The trapdoor opening. The palm sized cylinders being released into the
world below, like a machine giving birth to death. The impact of the cylinders and your vision becoming a
bright, bright white.

The utter absurdity of the situation dawns on you and all you have the time for is to laugh before your shadow
gets burned into the ground beneath you forever, the only remaining evidence that you ever walked this planet,
an alter to your memory.
