Food. That is all you can think about.

Shrivelled up on the floor, from the corner of your eye you can see food all around you, from a full 6 course
meal to a small ration pack.

But when you reach out to grab it, it slowly fades away, as if it were never there in the first place.

You can feel your body temperature gradually drop.

Every shiver is a ticking timer, knowing at any moment your consciousness, your very existence will disappear.

As your life flashes before your eyes like an ephemeral dream, you resolve that you will not die here.

You will see the end of the invasion and cheer in joy alongside everyone else when all the aliens are dead.

You can almost see it. Staring at your left arm, you know that there is nothing left to lose.

Your arm screams in pain as your teeth sink into your flesh.

Ignoring the pain, you continue, all for a miniscule hope that you will live just a second longer. You close
your eyes, harden your resolve, and focus all your strength to rip off a small piece of your flesh. But. You
canâ€™t do it.

You feel you strength fade away from you. You know this is the end. As you close your eyes for the last time,
you realize what despair truly is. The more you yearn to live, the greater the pain when death finally pulls
you into its embrace.
