There is no god. Only power. Once upon a time, we prayed to a higher being, in the hopes that our endless
servitude will one day bear fruit. We once prayed for riches, then water, then salvation. As the salvation we
so fervently prayed for never came, we placed our faith to the nobles, the aristocrats. At least they answered
our prayers, occasionally showering us with droplets of water in exchange for our souls. I once wondered, what
is it like being an aristocrat? To look down upon all other beings with mere contempt as if they were merely
bugs waiting to be squashed under our feet. To live a life of luxury built on the deaths and suffering of
others, ignoring the sacrifices of the people that helped maintain their lifestyle. As a being that is a bug, a
being that sacrificed my entire existence to help the nobles be as happy as they can possibly be, I yearned
that life. More than anything else in the universe. I thought I would experience that here, surrounded by an
insignificant species with such feeble and insignificant military. But all I experienced so far is heart
rending pain. Looking at them running away in fear, breaking down and hugging each other one last time before
they perish. It all reminds me of myself. The endless screams and tears brought back memories I once shoved in
the back of my mind. Why is our salvation built on the deaths of billions of others? This universe is a cruel
and unjust place. But such is life.
