You sigh as you step into the remains of your former house again.

Some emotions still rush through you, but not as intensely as before.

This time though, you feel more confident in yourself. Equipped with a laser rifle, you feel that you could
kill any alien you wanted to.

But the overwhelming power of the aliens still scares you.

You decide to be as careful as the first time you went outside, not getting blinded by the arrogance of merely
killing one alien.

Like before, you stealthily make your way towards the mound of corpses, now a massive tower tens of meters tall
and the only salient feature in this godforsaken town.

It feels easier to evade the gazes of aliens, which is perhaps due to more experience from last time, but also
due to your rifle.

You know that if you meet a lone alien patrolling the area, you should be able to dispose of him with ease.

As you climb up the hill of corpses, the putrid stench and the various wriggling maggots tunnelling into the orifices makes you gag.

Gritting your teeth and persevering, you continue upwards, cursing the aliens under your breath as you do, even
while knowing it is futile.

When you reach the top, you survey the area like you did a few days back.

The supermarket, surprisingly, is still intact, and in another direction, you see a survivor, perhaps the same one you saw last time.

Like before, you could immediately go to the supermarket, or approach the survivor.
