You remember a staircase going from the attic to the ground floor.

You slowly tiptoe to the staircase, each footstep more deliberate than the last to prevent the creaking boards
from giving away your position.

After descending the stairs, you peek into out the corner of the door and see the alien with his back towards
you staring into the distance.

You knock over a bunch of boxes in the storage room and hide behind the door.

The alien, startled by the sudden noise, slowly walked towards the the storage room with his energy daggers
unsheathed.

As the alien enters the room, he looks around surveying what happened.

He spots the scattered boxes in the corner and approaches it, still wary about any potential intruder.

As he bends down to pick up the boxes to inspect what happened, you jump out with knife in hand and stab at the
alien.

Before he notices you, you behead him.

His lifeless body collapses on the floor, and the pale blue blood gushing out from his severed head paints your
body with blood.

Worried that other aliens would notice, you quickly nab the laser rifle.

Right before you were about to leave, you spotted a thin object coming out of his pockets.

Reaching out, you grabbed the item.

You run out of the storage room towards the heap of food and throw some of them into your bag, escaping soon
after.
