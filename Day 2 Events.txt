You awaken, the strange events of yesterday fading into an almost dreamlike haze, until you realize that you’re
still surrounded by four concrete walls underground, your screens are still off, and there is still no power.

You sit up and the sleep wears off, and you realize you have absolutely nothing to do.

You pace around, a mixture of anxiety and boredom bubbling up in your chest and threatening to spill over.

You just know you should’ve hooked up those screens to an external power source, because although it’s only
been a day, having only the colour grey for company has been incredibly suffocating.

The more you imagine the warmth of the sun and the colours aboveground, the stronger your desire to experience
it all again becomes.

Do you give into temptations and go outside, or stay where you are?
