“Hi Awab, it’s me. I know you must be feeling wary because of everything that has happened recently, but I
harbour no ill intent. As fellow survivors, I believe it is best for us to work together in hopes that we will
one day walk out of this situation alive”.

Awab stares at you silently and a contemplative look arises on his face.

Before he responds, you slowly walk up to Awab, with your left hand primed to grab your knife and your right
hand reaching out towards Awab.

He also reaches his hand out, but his right hand is still hidden underneath his cloak.

All of a sudden, he lunges forwards and thrusts his knife towards your neck.

You jerk your body to the side, and Awab responds by retracting his arm and slashing out, aiming at your
carotid artery.

You duck down while simultaneously shoving your knee towards his crotch.

Before he could respond, your knee lands on his crotch and he stumbles backwards, quivering from the intense
pain.

As he is recoiling from the shock, you unsheath your knife and slash out towards his arm to make him drop his
knife.

Desperation fills his eyes, which hardens into resolve.

As Awab’s knife leaves his hand, he knows he is destined to die.

As your knife was on its path towards Awab’s neck, he shrieks loud enough for the entire neighborhood to hear.

As his voice leaves his throat, it got replaced with a knife.

As his life dissipates, he stares at you one last time with hateful eyes, a sneer emerging on his mouth, as if
mocking your for your stupidity to not dismember his vocal cords.

A loud bang sounds behind you, and Awab’s sneering face is the last thing you see as the world fades to black.
