You’re running. The world is overrun with aliens and you’re running, running, running.

There has to be somewhere safe.

The aliens have brought with them a virus against which humanity has no immunity.

There are people stumbling in the streets, shells of their former selves who do not know, nor remember.

Their skin is sagging and drooping from their bones, dropping off their bones.

You slow down and for the briefest moment, you accidentally gaze into one’s eyes.

Yours are fiery and scared. Theirs are sullen, empty, dead. And then they charge at you.

Some primal, dormant instincts activated by contact with a sort of alien genetics that the invaders are
unknowing carriers of.

You’re off again, searching, stumbling, silently screaming for someone, for anyone, for help.

You’ve lost your original pursuers, so you stop in the alleyway, gasping for air.

You are finally alone, except for the small girl in a pink dress and her mother.

You watch them carefully make their way across, hand in hand, stepping over cracked roads and jagged chunks of
concrete.

The girl trips, and upon catching herself, also catches your eye.

She’s there before you know it, sprinting faster than a four year old should be able to. You’re cornered and
there’s no way to flee. Your hands come out before you know it, one clutching a hunting knife and the other a
prayer. She can’t slow down in time. She’s impaled on the knife before she knows it, a spray of blood filling
your vision as you pull your arm back. She sinks down, her pink dress now sporting crimson flowers in bloom.

Her mother is nowhere in sight. You sink to your knees and shut your eyes.
