Excited by the prospect of seeing another person alive, you quickly but carefully make your way across to the
lone survivor.

As you make your way through, you break down internally from the surrounding ramshackle houses.

The realization that most of your neighbors are most likely dead, whose vestige only lives on in the faint
memories you share with them crumbles your mental state.

Because of that, you get excited to meet the only other person alive in the neighborhood, hoping that it’s
someone you once knew.

Eventually, you catch up to him, with the faint ray of sunshine illuminating his dreary disposition.

He is a middle aged Pakistani man with deep dark circles under his eyes, as if he hasn’t slept for days.

His tattered, blood stained cloak fluttered in the wind, giving him a more imposing appearance.

After noticing your presence, you could see a scowl appear on his face, though hidden by his thick and
overgrown beard.

After inspecting him, you realized that he was one of your neighbors, Awab Qureshi.

Before the invasion, you weren’t very close to him. Seeing each other every now and then while saying hi was
the extent of your relationship.

You could either try to befriend him and fill the void of human interaction you yearn for, or you could kill
him and steal all of his belongings, with a bit of guilt and remorse.
