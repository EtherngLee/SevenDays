You remember a staircase going from the attic to the ground floor.

You slowly tiptoe to the staircase, each footstep more deliberate than the last to prevent the creaking boards
from giving away your position.

After descending the stairs, you see your prize right in front of you: all the food and water needed to last
the next month.

Just as your greed was seducing you to lower your guard and just shove all the items in your bag, you catch
yourself midway, realizing the foolishness of your decision.

You recollect yourself and assess your surrounding. The alien is still facing in the opposite direction,
guarding against intruders approaching from the front.

Since the coast seems clear, you take one more deep breathe and sneak towards the supplies.

You quietly start filling your bag with drinks and canned food, while occasionally looking taking quick glances
towards the alien to make sure he is distracted.

Shivers suddenly run down your spine.

You freeze up, feeling every muscle in your body tighten as your senses are heightened to the max.

You slowly turn your head back, with your hand reaching towards your combat knife.

The alien is standing behind you with an excited and psychopathic grin on his face.

As you look at the alien, he slashes out with the flash from the energy blade appearing for a brief moment.

Losing all sensation from your neck and below, you realized in the short moment before your death that you have
been beheaded.

Just as you closed your eyes one last time, you saw contempt and mockery in his eyes, laughing at the fall of
your pitiful existence.
