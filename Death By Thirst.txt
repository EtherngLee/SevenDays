It burns. Your entire body is screaming for water, for liquid, for something to quell the fire raging in your
throat and your cells and your tongue which is heavy as the lead settling inside of your bones.

Your taste buds are stained with blood.

You want to, no need to swallow but you can’t because your mouth is parched and cracked and your muscles won’t
respond to your jumbled commands.

It hurts. Your head is splitting into a thousand fragments—shattered glass thoughts splintering and doubling
and doubling and spinning like your vision so you shut your eyes to the blurring around you.

And everything slows.

The dark darkens. The screams quiet. Then all is silent.
