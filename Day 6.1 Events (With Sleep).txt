You awake with a start, surrounded by an army of aliens.

They draw near, laser rifles at the ready.

You put your hands up in what you hope is a universal gesture of surrender but still, they advance.

So you grab the laser rifle you stole and point it right back.

Thinking hard, you realize you have no idea how they would have gotten in. If they could teleport, you would
have seen this happen or have heard about it. The only way to get in and out involves knowledge only you
possess.

But you donâ€™t have time to dwell on this.

The aliens are raising their rifles and pointing them at you, appendages twitching dangerously close to the
triggers.

Do you shoot?
