“Hi Awab, it’s me. I know you must be feeling wary because of everything that has happened recently, but I
harbour no ill intent. As fellow survivors, I believe it is best for us to work together in hopes that we will
one day walk out of this situation alive”.

Awab stared at you silently and a contemplative look arises on his face.

You silently pray that he will accept your offer, with every delusion about having a potential partner lowering
your guard against him.

After what felt like an eternity of silence, Awab slowly stands up and reaches out his hand.

Blinded by the joy of finding a fellow comrade in your journey, you stumble closer to him, and slowly reached
out your hand in order to shake his.

All of a sudden, you feel the blood ooze out of you as he lumbers forward and thrusts a knife into your neck.

It doesn’t hurt, at least not yet, but your throat makes a terrible gurgling sound and you feel it begin to
fill with blood.

You stumble as shock sets in, confounded by his sudden betrayal and your realization of how your desperation of
companionship led to your naivety.

Your opponent takes advantage of this and slashes wildly at you once more.

You fall to the ground, pressing your hand against your wounds which are sticky and seeping into the hard
pavement around you.
