Thankfully, you are no longer panicking, but your thoughts are muddy from a lack of sleep.

It takes you some time to notice the army of aliens surrounding you.

They draw near, laser rifles pointed at you and ready to shoot.

You put your hands up in what you hope is a universal gesture of surrender but still, they advance.

So you grab the laser rifle you stole and point it right back.

You have to act fast; the aliensâ€™ appendages are twitching dangerously close to their triggers.

Do you shoot?
